        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p id="linux_p">
            I have used linux since my freshman year of college, 2021. I had been studying psychology and was approaching the realization that the major was not for me. I wasn't sure what I would do instead though, but had always been passionate about computers and was becoming interested in Cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first foray into linux was with Kali, which I dual booted on my laptop alongside Windows. This was moreso to experiment with using a different operating system than to experiment with Kali itself though I learned a good deal, and was able to show off my ability to crack WPA-2 passwords to my peers using aircrack. I also experimented with wireshark and ran some hacks on metasploit.
        </p>

        <p> Since, I have taken Unix/Linux Fundamentals which has given me a large boost to my bash scripting abilities, though I was already comfortable with the basics of working in a linux environment and navigating the filesystem. Currently, I use Manjaro as my main distro.
        </p>

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p id="java_p">
            I began working with Java in August of 2022. Before this, I had done some sporadic "programming" with HTML, CSS, some javascript, and mostly JSON file editing for modding games. I fell in love with programming after my first Hello World program. Programming is absolutely my passion and I love every moment of it, from the depths of bug fixing to the catharsis of finally writing functional code.
            <p> My programming abilities have consistently been more advanced than the majority of my peers because I continue learning and practicing in my free time. I have written a variety of advanced programs in Java and am quite confident in my abilities to tackle any situation in front of me, though I'm not afraid to sit down and research a problem when I need to.
            </p>

        </div>

        <h2>C#</h2>
        <p id="C#_p">
            I have been using C# since October of 2022, and have already gained a strong understanding of the language. I use C# in Unity Game Editor projects and have probably written my best code in this language. Currently, I am working on a game revolving around a simulated genetics system that is accurate to the real world genetics of the creatures I'm emulating! I'm extremely passionate about this project in particular as it has not only a source of great creative inspiration, but gives me a way to learn many different aspects of programming and computer science in an environment where my progress is directly visible.
        </p>

        <h2>Unity</h2>
        <p id="unity_p">
            I have been using the Unity Game Editor since October of 2022. While I am fairly experienced with the software and have already made great progress on my main project, I am aware that there is still a good deal that I don't know yet. Because of this, I am continuing to research and work in the environment as often as I can, making frequent visits to the documentation, so that I can master Unity and become a stronger developer. My work in Unity has also exposed me to a much wider range of content and skills than programming alone would.

        </div>

        <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p id="html_css_p">
            I am quite experienced with HTML & CSS as I do web dev work in my day to day. I have experience creating dynamic web apps with Node.js utilizing frameworks like Vue.js.
        </p>

        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p id="hardware_p">
            I love taking things apart to see how they work, and working with computer hardware is a great way to engage with this interest. In October of 2023, I built a PC based around gaming in Linux, something that has come with its own set of puzzles to solve.
        </p>

        <h2>GIMP</h2>
        <p id="gimp_p">
            I have a great deal of experience with photo and video editing software, as I have always been interested in creative endeavors. I use GIMP in order to make art for games, icons for websites and UIs, edit photos and documents, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p id="git_p">
            I have used Github for years, looking through code uploaded by other programmers to learn and find cool projects, but didn't start to truly recognize the vitality of source control until I started writing code. I have a few repositories that I push to on this personal account and quite a few more on my work account.

        <h2>Cayden Scruggs, University of South Carolina</h2>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 1vh" ;>Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, May 2025</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cayden Scruggs, and I love to create. From writing and drawing to programming and developing, anything that allows me to put my mind to work and come up with novel solutions and new ideas gives me a firey drive like no other. I have written countless poems and short stories as well as a novel, constructed a student council campaign that caught the attention of a United States presidential candidate, designed multiple games, and created clever programs to solve the problems I face in my day to day life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I struggled to find the drive to focus in my Chemistry class for a while, so I created command line applications to do simple chemical calculations for me as well as give flashcards for me to study. I live my life searching for ways to make things better, and I try to translate that into my work. I don't know nearly everything about my field, but I am always willing and excited to research new topics in order to solve problems and widen my abilities as a programmer. Currently, I am hoping to find a job that prioritizes creative programming and am interested in pursuing topics like game design and machine learning.
